# Issue Recorder
Issue Recorder lets you save all comments on an issue to a file in your repository or within another issue. Markdown is fully supported.

It is assumed to work by triggering the issue closed event. For instance, when you close an issue, it starts to work and saves all the comments, including their body, on the issue you close to a specific file or another issue you configure.

It doesn't take any effect if you specify an option that is not relevant to the mode you select. For example, if you set a mode to `file` and specify `target_issue_repo`, the option is merely ignored.

[^mode]: If you want to save to both of them, you can use a comma-separated value like `file, issue`.

[^target_issue_number]: If you specify the special identifier `latest`, the latest open issue on the specified repository will be obtained. If there is no open issue in the target repository, the action fails.

[^fold_threshold]: If you specify the empty string `""`, the special identifier `infinity`, or don't specify anything, this option will be disabled.

[^token_permission]: If you don't specify `personal_access_token`, [`GITHUB_TOKEN`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#about-the-github_token-secret) will be used. It is useful, but it has lower permissions, so you need your personal access token with stronger permissions sometimes, like when you want to save a file to another repository by using the `target_file_repo` option. For details on how to retrieve and store your personal access token, see [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#granting-additional-permissions). If you want to know each permission for the `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret, [this article](https://dev.classmethod.jp/articles/mapping-secrets-github-token/#toc-2) might help you. Don't forget to set the environment variable under the `env` key in your YAML file. The [Workflow sample](#workflow-sample) section might help you.

[^partial_content_target_issue_repo_empty]: The error occurs when not specified, even though the partial content exists.

[^skip_if_empty_restriction]: You can't use `skip_if_empty_including_body` and `skip_if_empty_not_including_body` simultaneously.

#### Time format sample
Here are some examples of the time formats. You can customize the time format other than the examples below.

| Style             | Format                     | Example                                              |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| GitHub comments   | `MMM d, yyyy, h:mm a ZZZZ` | <blockquote>Jun 30, 2023, 6:55 PM GMT+9</blockquote> |
| X (Twitter) posts | `h:mm a Â· MMM d, yyyy`     | <blockquote>6:55 PM Â· Jun 30, 2023</blockquote>      |

#### About partial content
You can transfer the words or sentences in the issue body and the issue comment partially. The portion is converted into like `[^pvt_1234567]` in the repository specified in `target_file_repo` and the issue specified in `target_issue_repo`, and the original content is saved to the issue specified in `partial_content_target_issue_repo`. Here is the example of how it works.

Let's say you set the options related to this function like that.

| Key                                   | Value            |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `target_file_repo`                    | `octocat/repo-a` |
| `target_issue_repo`                   | `octocat/repo-b` |
| `target_issue_number`                 | `1`              |
| `partial_content_target_issue_repo`   | `octocat/repo-c` |
| `partial_content_target_issue_number` | `2`              |
| `partial_content_start_string`        | `<private>`      |
| `partial_content_end_string`          | `</private>`     |

And you leave a comment like the following.

```markdown
I bumped into one of my best friends <private>(Tevin)</private> and we had a blast.
```

When the action works, the content like the following will be saved to `octocat/repo-a` as a file and posted to the issue `octocat/repo-b/issues/1`.

```markdown
I bumped into one of my best friends [^pvt_1234567] and we had a blast.
```

As for the original content between `partial_content_start_string` and `partial_content_end_string`, it will be posted to the issue `octocat/repo-c/issues/2` like the following.

```markdown
| Reference | Content |
| :---: | --- |
| `[^pvt_1234567]` | Tevin |

[^pvt_1234567]: Tevin
```

**NOTE**: You can use the regular expression in `partial_content_start_string` and `partial_content_end_string`. In other words, if you want to use characters treated in the regular expression as those characters, you need to sanitize them. You don't have to escape `/`.

#### Special identifier for `notification_comment`
You can use the following special identifiers for `notification_comment`.

| Identifier            | Replaced with                        | Example                                                                                                                               |

| `<FILE_URL_WITH_SHA>` | A full URL for a file with SHA       | `https://github.com/noraworld/issue-recorder/blob/5c26bf402176693178f8497324fc9b862bdd4a3b/issues/00/42/4201_purchase-boiled-eggs.md` |
| `<REF_NAME>`          | A branch name pointing to a commit   | `main`                                                                                                                                |

For instance, if you specify `The content of this task was saved in [<FILE_PATH>](<FILE_URL>)`, the actual comment is like this:

```
The content of this task was saved in [issues/00/42/4201_purchase-boiled-eggs.md](https://github.com/noraworld/issue-recorder/blob/main/issues/00/42/4201_purchase-boiled-eggs.md)
```
